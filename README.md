# Pokemon api client

This project is created for learning and simple referencing when needed. It demostrates the following
- Api calls (fetching)
- Hooks, useState and useEffect
- Auto up scrolling
- Callback function chaining


# Note
Because of the nature of this project it is deeply integrated with the pokemon Api [https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon]

For anyone who is beginning to learn react i advise to create the same project, without help from external packages such as redux, most features created is done without packages except for SWR for api calls and pagination.
